## Options

You can pass the following options to `autocomplete()`

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-------: | :---:| ----------- |
|`container` `(Required)`|`HTMLElement`|This is the `HTMLElement` container in which the input element will be generated.|
|`onInput` `(Required)`| `Function(query, displayMatches)`| This function is called when the user types in the input field in order to generate autocomplete suggestions. The first parameter is the current value of the input field.  The second parameter is a callback function which should be called with an array of matches to be displayed as autocomplete suggestions.|
|`formatMatch`|`Function(match)` | This function is run for every match generated by `onInput`. It should return a `String` or an `HTMLElement` which will be used as the formatted autocomplete suggestion. If this function is not provided, the `match` item itself will be used as the suggestion.|
|`clearBtnEnabled`| `Boolean`| Provides a button to the right of the input field that will clear the field. The button is only present when the input field is not empty. This option also causes the input value to revert to last selected value when the input field loses focus. The default value is `false`|
|`onClear`|`Function`| This function will be called when the input is cleared (either with the clear button or manually with backspace) |
|`onSelect`|`Function(selectedMatch)`| This function will be called when the user selects a suggestion (either by clicking on a suggestion or by hitting the Enter key). The parameter is the match item provided by `onInput`|
|`initialValue`|`String`| Sets an autofill value for the input field. |
|`placeholder`|`String`| Sets a placeholder value for the input field.|
